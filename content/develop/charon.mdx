---

Anonymous ephemeral chat and file sharing for the I2P network.

## Features

- **Ephemeral Rooms** - Chat rooms that automatically expire
- **Anonymous Identity** - Consistent identity per room, different across rooms
- **File Sharing** - Upload and share files (up to 300MB)
- **No Tracking** - No cookies, no logs, no localStorage
- **I2P Integration** - Designed for the I2P anonymous network

## Requirements

- Java 21 or later
- (Optional) I2P router with SAM API enabled

## Usage

### Create a Room

1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/new
2. Set room name (optional) and duration
3. Choose public or private
4. Click "Create Room"

### Join a Room

- **Public rooms**: Browse at http://127.0.0.1:8080/pub
- **Private rooms**: Use invite link

### File Sharing

1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/files
2. Drag & drop or select a file
3. Share the file link

## Architecture

```
~/.charon/
├── charon.db      # SQLite database (rooms, files)
└── identity.key   # Master key for identity generation
```

### Identity System

Your identity is derived from a master key stored at `~/.charon/identity.key`.

- Same room = Same identity (prevents impersonation)
- Different rooms = Different identity (protects privacy)


## Tech Stack

- **Scala 3** with Cats Effect 3
- **Http4s** (Ember) for HTTP/WebSocket
- **Doobie** for SQLite
- **Circe** for JSON
- **Twirl** for templates
